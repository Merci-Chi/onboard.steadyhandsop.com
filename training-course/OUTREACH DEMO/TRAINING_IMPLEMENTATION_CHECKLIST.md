## 5. Commissions and expectations

- [ ] Explain Waiting on Payment vs Pending vs Earned
- [ ] Include chargeback/refund handling, professional standards and escalation procedures

## Training page integration
- [ ] Integrate HTML styling with the existing Outreach Training navigation
- [ ] Place a 'Read Guide' PDF link in each section
- [ ] Replace audio placeholders with final audio only when available
- [ ] Add real, permission-aware progress persistence; prototype currently uses browser storage only
- [ ] Make each demo's reset/completion behavior explicit
- [ ] Keep simulated actions isolated from live prospects, calling, payment and development systems
- [ ] Verify mobile layout, keyboard controls and screen-reader labels
- [ ] Test in Safari and on phones before release

## Prototype usage
The standalone `training-preview.html` demonstrates layout and interactions, including:
1. Add selected leads to a queue
2. Complete a call and set a follow-up
3. Handle a skeptical prospect
4. Convert a sale to a client
5. Submit a development handoff
6. Guide a customer through the client portal

**Prototype limitations:** The buttons simulate training actions. They do not change your production database or queue, transmit customer messages, or transfer work to development. PDF and audio controls are placeholders.
